# Roblox-Headless

Roblox-Headless is a fork of [rbx-silent](https://github.com/toastering/rbxsilent) which aims to provide more functionality from the original.

## Changes

1. Added a keybind system to hide/unhide the clients.
2. Added a function to kill all running clients.
3. Automatically changes the clients process priority to low.

## Installation

Download the exe from the [Releases](https://github.com/sebi12391/Roblox-Headless/releases) page and run it.

## Usage

After running Roblox-Headless, it will default to hiding all running instances of the Roblox client.

Rshift = hide/unhide all clients.\
END = Close all running instances and the program.
